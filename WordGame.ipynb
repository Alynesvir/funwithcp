        "- display a list of letters (with duplicates)\n",
        "- prompt the player to enter a word using the displayed letters\n",
        "- if a word is accepted, display an acknowledgement and the remaining unused letters\n",
        "- if a word is invalid (not using the remaining letters), display error and prompt for input again\n",
        "- game terminates when\n",
