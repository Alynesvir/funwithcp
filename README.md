# Fun with Computing! :)

Computing is all around us. In this project, we encourage anyone to suggest/translate scenarios that they encounter in their everyday lives (current affairs, TV dramas/variety shows/movies, etc.) into Computing tasks that others can think about and write workable and elegant computer programs to solve (with or without the assistance of generative AI). The process is more important than the product, and we hope that the learning experience will empower people to appreciate and develop both hard and soft life skills, improve [digital literacies](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/educational-technology-journey/edtech-masterplan/digital-literacy-and-technological-skills#nine-digital-competencies): 
- computational thinking (abstraction, decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithm design)
- coding and programming 
- effective communication and collaboration
- creative and inventive thinking
- portfolio/credentials building

## How you can contribute to this project
- solve some tasks (multiple solutions acceptable)
- suggest some tasks (with sources)
- propose ideas to bring this project forward

We look forward to your pull requests! :)
